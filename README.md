# ammonia-combustion-psr-nox-control-
A numerical study of ammonia combustion in a Perfectly Stirred Reactor (PSR) focusing on the effects of equivalence ratio and inlet temperature on pollutant emissions (NO, NO₂, N₂O, and unburned NH₃), with the aim of developing strategies for low-NOx combustion.
